            <p class="text">
              The Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague is
              one of the leading scientific and educational institutions in the Czech Republic. Its unique equipment and
              experts in a relatively wide range of fields &ndash; from mathematics to physics, chemistry, material
              sciences,
              electronics, quantum technologies and nuclear reactors &ndash; have an international reputation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Experienced scientists participate in large-scale international projects directly on the faculty premises
              or during short-term and long-term trips abroad. Many of them work at the Swiss CERN, others at the
              American BNL, the South Korean KINGS, and at many other scientific workplaces and universities. Faculty
              employees also play essential leadership roles. Excellent references are returned to the faculty from
              foreign institutions by the faculty's students, who are directly involved in research work.

              The Faculty of Technical and Nuclear Physics was founded as a part of Charles University in 1955 to
              support the Czechoslovak nuclear programme. In the beginning, there were only three departments headed by
              famous Czech scientists enjoying international fame: the Department of Nuclear Physics was headed by
              Václav Petržílka, the Department of Chemistry by František Běhounek, and the Department of Nuclear
              Engineering by Bohumil Kvasil. Indeed, there were a number of other famous personalities present at the
              foundation of the Faculty, namely Vladimír Majer, Václav Votruba, and Čestmír Šimáně. In 1959, before the
              first graduates received their Master's Degrees, the Faculty officially withdrew from Charles University
              to join the Czech Technical University. The Faculty was established as a centre of science, research, and
              teaching and has always been focused on demanding fields of science and has initiated and fostered many
              more.

              Our Faculty offers programmes closely linked with their practical application right from the Bachelor
              Course, i.e. programmes reaching medicine, economics, IT, safety of the population, and other fields.
              Graduates start their career as highly-valued experts, never lacking in job offers. Cooperation with over
              140 universities and research establishments both at home and abroad and the small number of students make
              it possible to guarantee participation in addressing current scientific issues and their application and
              shorter or longer study stays or internships abroad.

              <p class="text">
                The Laboratory of Ion Beams of the Department of Physical Electronics (KFE) is concerned with the
                technique of ion beams, interactions of fast neutrons with solids, and applications of ion beams in
                modifications of thin surface layers of materials (IBMM), and their analyses (IBA).

              <p class="text">
                The nuclear experts at the Faculty devote their time to optimization of the middle part of the fuel
                cycle, which has considerable impact on the operation economy of nuclear power plants. In addition to
                assessing the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle, the experts are considering the possibility of introducing
                the thorium-uranium cycle or MOX fuel.

              <p class="text">
                The team participates in research on the Faculty’s GOLEM tokamak, COMPASS tokamak and the pan-European
                JET tokamak. In addition to conducting classes, the group studies application of high-temperature
                superconductors in tokamak operation, investigates the retention time of radiofrequency plasma excited
                by an electromagnetic wave in magnetic field, and maps poloidal asymmetry of plasma flow measured by the
                Mach probe field.
